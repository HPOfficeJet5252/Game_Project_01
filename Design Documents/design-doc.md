## Overall Vision for the Game
This section should provide a short summary or description of the game. Imagine you are ‘pitching’ the game to a friend while riding on an elevator. How would you describe the game in one minute or less? Why would they want to play it? What makes it sound fun and engaging?

## Target Audience
Great game designers always design their games with a specific audience in mind, and this section should describe that audience. For example, are you designing your game for young kids, older kids, or adults? Boys, girls, or both? Is the game designed for hard-core players who like deep, highly challenging games or casual players who like to play a little bit each day?

## Platform
Is the game designed to be played on a game console? A mobile device? The web? A good game design targets a specific platform and uses the capabilities of that platform to its advantage. Doing a 3D first person action game in a web browser is hard (but not impossible!), and you can’t count on your players having access to a joystick if they’re going to be playing on a smartphone.

## Genre
This section should describe the genre of the game. Popular genres include action, adventure, sports, strategy, puzzle, racing, platformer, and role-playing. Is the game a mix of genres (e.g. action-adventure or a clever combination that’s never been tried before)? Or maybe you have created an entirely new genre!

## Core Gameplay
This section should describe in detail what playing the game is like. Most game design documents will do this by talking about some or all of the following things:

    Core game mechanics: What is the player doing in the game? This is often best described through active verbs like running, jumping, racing, counting, puzzle solving, or exploring. Is the game single player or multiplayer? Cooperative or competitive?
    Goals: What is the player trying to accomplish in the game (i.e. what is the ‘win state’)? What does he or she have to do to achieve that goal? What barriers or obstacles exist that make achieving that goal difficult? How can the player fail at achieving the goal(s) (i.e. ‘loss states’)? What kind of feedback does the player get on progress towards the goal? How is the player rewarded when a goal is achieved?
    Components: What kinds of things are there in the game? For example, enemies, objects in the environment, power-ups, points, etc. What do they look like? What do they do? How can the player interact with them?
    Controls: How does the player control what happens in the game? What does pushing a certain button on the controller do? Can the player move a block by touching the screen and dragging it?
    User experience: When the player starts to play the game, what steps do they follow? What screens will they see? How are levels in the game structured? How does the player move from one part of the game to the next?

## Aesthetic
This section should describe the look, sound, and feel of the game. Where does the game take place: In the real world? A fantasy world? Space? Underground? In the past? In the future? Is the game a 2D world? A 3D World? What does the art look and feel like: Is it gritty and realistic, beautiful and fantastical or something else? Many GDD’s include drawings or graphics or temp music to illustrate the aesthetic concept.

## Characters and Storyline (if applicable)
This section should provide a short summary or description of the game. Imagine you are ‘pitching’ the game to a friend while riding on an elevator. How would you describe the game in one minute or less? Why would they want to play it? What makes it sound fun and engaging?
